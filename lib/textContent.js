  `Artificial intelligence has become an essential tool in our daily lives, 
  from virtual assistants to medical diagnosis, but it is not perfect. In many cases, 
  AI models can have significant biases that can affect decision making and perpetuate 
  discrimination. Our mission is to shed light on the biases present in AI models and 
  their impact on decision making.`,
  `To showcase the biases that exist in AI models, we have trained multiple dense neural 
  networks using openly available census data from IPUMS2. We have made different models 
  with singular changes to the dataset/inputs to observe the variation in output, determining 
  how impactful specific changes can be on the models’ decision making and accuracy. By observing the effects 
  that certain omissions such as race, religion, sex and many other variables, can have on the 
  accuracy of models, we hope to raise awareness of the importance of addressing biases in AI.`,
  `Our web application is designed to be interactive and user-friendly. Users can modify various 
  filters and clearly visualize the biases present in the neural networks. We look at metrics such 
  as accuracy, false positive, and false negative rates (both for the entire dataset and for individual 
    groups to find any disparities in performance). Our goal is to educate and empower the public with 
    the knowledge needed to advocate for more inclusive and less biased AI models.`,
